# BMICalculator

## Description

The BMICalculator application was created in Python using the Tkinter library to build the user interface (GUI). It is a simple tool that enables tracking of user weight and body mass index (BMI) as well as calculating their daily calorie needs.

## Features

- **Weight Tracking:** Users can input their weight regularly, and the application stores and displays the change history.
- **BMI Calculation:** Based on the entered weight and height, the application automatically calculates the user's body mass index (BMI).
- **Caloric Needs:** By providing data such as age, gender, height, weight, and level of physical activity, the application calculates the daily amount of calories needed for maintenance, gaining, or losing weight.
- **Charts:** Using the Matplotlib library, the application generates charts depicting the weight change history and other relevant information.

## Requirements

To run the application, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3.12
- Tkinter
- Matplotlib `pip install matplotlib`

## Running the Application
